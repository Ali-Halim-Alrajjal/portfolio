                <h3 style="color: #6049ea;">Full-Scale Email and Domain Migration to AWS</h3>
                <span style="font-size: x-small;">At Yogous</span>

                <p>

                    I led the end-to-end migration of Yogous's digital infrastructure from GoDaddy to Amazon Web
                    Services (AWS). The
                    primary business drivers were to reduce operational costs, escape the limitations of a shared
                    hosting environment, and
                    gain the flexibility of a cloud-native ecosystem.
                    <br><br>
                    The project involved two parallel streams: email and domain management. For email, I orchestrated
                    the seamless
                    transition to Amazon WorkMail, where I provisioned and managed user mailboxes and created functional
                    email groups to
                    improve internal communication. Understanding the criticality of email data, I implemented a
                    risk-mitigation strategy
                    that included instructing all staff to create local backups of their mailboxes prior to the cutover.
                    <br><br>
                    For the domain migration, I meticulously documented and backed up all existing DNS records
                    (including A, CNAME, and MX
                    records) from GoDaddy to prevent service disruption. After transferring the domains to AWS Route 53,
                    I reconfigured the
                    records, which granted us granular control over our web presence. This move to Route 53 not only
                    enhanced DNS management
                    but also streamlined the integration of other AWS services and future third-party tools,
                    significantly improving our
                    architectural agility.

                <span style="font-size: x-small;">At Yogous</span>
                <p>

                    I was a key contributor to the development and launch of two primary corporate websites. For the
                    main <a href="https://yogous.com/index.html" target="_blank">yogous.com</a> domain, I was
                    responsible for the end-to-end
                    creation of several critical pages, including "Serve With Us," "Go With Us," "Earn With Us," and the
                    "Contact Us" and
                    "Thank You" pages. This involved translating design mockups into fully functional, responsive web
                    pages using HTML, CSS,
                    and JavaScript.
                    <br><br>
                    I also collaborated on the <a href="https://yogous.com/Tech/yogous_tech_eng.html"
                        target="_blank">Yogous Tech</a> sub-site, where I enhanced shared components and led a front-end
                    refactor that improved the navigation bar's functionality and user experience across all pages.
                    Furthermore, I built and configured the production environment, deploying both websites to Amazon
                    EC2 instances to ensure high availability and seamless integration with our existing AWS services.

                <span style="font-size: x-small;">Personal</span>
                <p>

                    I am currently developing a full-stack web application designed to democratize professional
                    automotive diagnostics. The platform allows users to input their vehicle's make, model, year, and
                    diagnostic trouble code (DTC). The core functionality leverages an AI-powered engine to analyze this
                    data and provide a detailed, human-readable report outlining the likely issue, potential causes, and
                    recommended next steps.
                    <br><br>
                    The live front-end prototype has been successfully deployed and can be viewed here:
                    <a href="https://incomparable-gumdrop-cf7232.netlify.app" target="_blank">Mecshop</a>. This ongoing
                    project showcases my ability to conceptualize a real-world solution, manage full-stack development,
                    and integrate advanced technologies.
